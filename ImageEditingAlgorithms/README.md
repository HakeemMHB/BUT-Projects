  C++ Project
Here is a C++ project that involved manipulating images, particularly RGB pixels. We had to create filters and then apply them to the pixels of the image.
In this directory, you will find the .h files which contain the function signatures as well as constants, and the .cpp files which contain the function definitions. You will also find a main file.
