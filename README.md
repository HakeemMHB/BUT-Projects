# BUT-Projects

 Here are some of the projects I completed during my first and third semester of the Computer Science Bachelor's program at Orsay.

The project titled "DataCratie" consists of creating a web platform for participatory democracy, where we developed a website using PHP, created a graphical interface with Java SWING, and linked them with a custom-built database. The platform allows users to manage referendums and participate in votes.

The project titled "ImageEditingAlgorithms" involves using the C++ language to create image editing algorithms.

The project titled "DevelopmentOfaSpecificationsDocument" entails utilizing our knowledge of business management and law to develop a specifications document.

The project titled "DataBaseCreationProject" primarily utilizes SQL language and Oracle software to create and model a database.

Finally, the project titled "InstallationOfaDevelopmentWorkstation" involves using the Linux language to configure a Raspberry Pi.

In each project, you will find a README.md file that provides more details on each project.

I wish you a pleasant exploration through my projects !
