# BUT-Projects

 Here are some of the projects I completed during my first semester of the Computer Science Bachelor's program at Orsay.

The project titled "ImageEditingAlgorithms" involves using the C++ language to create image editing algorithms.

The project titled "DevelopmentOfaSpecificationsDocument" entails utilizing our knowledge of business management and law to develop a specifications document.

The project titled "DataBaseCreationProject" primarily utilizes SQL language and Oracle software to create and model a database.

Finally, the project titled "InstallationOfaDevelopmentWorkstation" involves using the Linux language to configure a Raspberry Pi.

In each project, you will find a README.md file that provides more details on each project. Unfortunately, I was unable to include my web project, which involved creating a website, as it was too large for GitHub.

I wish you a pleasant exploration through my projects !
