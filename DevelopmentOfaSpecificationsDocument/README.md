  Developement of a Specifications Document
  
This project involved developing a specifications document for a publishing house named Caribou. We created and modeled the micro and macro environment of a publishing house, its interaction diagram, and its technical organizational chart. We had the opportunity to interview booksellers and publishers to better understand their needs. This project allowed us to understand the importance of a specifications document, the first step before carrying out a project.

You will find in this folder the report of our project, which contains all the steps involved in creating the specifications document.
