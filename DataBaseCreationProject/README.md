  Database Creation Project
  
This project involved creating and modeling a database.
Therefore, we had to model the ERD and relational schema of the database.
We also had to write the scripts for creating and inserting data, in order to be able to process them in the end.

In this folder, you will find SQL files containing the codes for creating the database, inserting data, and executing queries.
And in an SQLite file, the entire database is stored.
