# Datacratie

This project involved creating a web platform for participatory democracy. We developed a website using PHP, designed a graphical interface with Java SWING, and linked both with a MySQL database. The platform allows users to manage referendums and participate in votes.

In the *datacratie* folder, you will find 3 subfolders:
- The **datacratieAPI** folder contains the Java SWING code for the graphical interface.
- The **datacratieUI** folder contains the PHP code for the website.
- The **PartieBD_GAYMAY-PIVET-BHATOO** folder contains our database creation scripts as well as a report detailing everything.

## Technologies Used
- **PHP** for the web platform
- **Java SWING** for the graphical interface
- **MySQL** for the database
